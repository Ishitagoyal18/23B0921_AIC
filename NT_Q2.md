## SOP for AI Community

**Hi, I am Ishita, a CSE undergrad at IIT BOMBAY. As a CSE student,I am really passionate about coding specially in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.**

**My special interest in this field started when I participated in the WiDS initiative, where I worked on a project to detect brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and it was succesful. This was my first experience with a Machine Learning project where I learnt all the basics of machine learning and it sparked my excitement and curiosity about AI and ML.
I loved the process of making a model and this was excited to explore more in this field. Even while working on this assignment I learned many new things about CNN and really enjoyed working on it. It just fueled up my motivation to join this community.**
**I am proficient in *numpy, matplotplib, pandas, keras and tensorflow* libraries of python and worked on many projects as well and have succesfully completed them as well.**

**I think being a part of AI Community is a perfect opputunity to explore this field and enhance my skills.It will also help me in teaching team work and to work under pressure specially when preparing for hackathons. My ultimate goal is to learn AIML and I think this will help me fulfill this.
If selected in the team I will give my best to it and will devote my proper time to this community along with managing my academics.
Thank you**
