### Q1. Timeline of events if Hackathon was 1 month away.
_________________
### Week 1: Understanding the Problem and Gathering Resources
  ##### Day 1-2: Problem Statement Analysis
   * Team meets for reviewing the hackathon guidelines and problem statement thoroughly.
   * Formulating problem statement properly making sure everyone is clear about it.
   * Dividing tasks to understand requirements, constraints, and research existing solutions.
 ##### Day 3-4: Data Collection and Exploration
   * Acquiring datasets from different resources and exploring them to understand their structure, features, and potential challenges, making sure they cover diverse topics.
   * The most important part is to align the  team on overall approach and dividing responsibilites to ensure all the tasks are done on time
 ##### Day 5-7: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   * Performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution of 
     features, correlations, and patterns
   * Visualizing the data using plots and graphs to gain insights into the data's 
     characteristics
### Week 2: Advanced Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
   ##### Day 8-10: Data Preprocessing
   * Dividing into smaller sub groups for data preprocessing tasks.
   * Cleaning the data by removing special characters, URLs, and stop words and encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   * Spliting the data into training, validation, and test sets
   ##### Day 11-14: Feature Engineering
   * Discussing with the team and creating new features based on domain knowledge or insights 
    from EDA.
   * Performing feature scaling or transformation if necessary.
   * Experimenting with different feature selection techniques.
   * Regular team check ins to ensure everyone is on board. 
### Week 3: Model Development and Optimization
  ##### Day 15-17: Model Selection
  
*Implementing baseline models and establishing performance benchmarks.
*Collaboratively identifying areas for improvement in the initial models.
*Experimenting with different techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods.
##### Day 18-21: Model Optimization
* Refining and optimizing models based on team discussions and feedbacks
* Continuously evaluating model performance and providing constructive feedback
  * Validating model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the validation set.
### Week 4: Finalizing and Testing the Solution
 ##### Day 22-25: Integration
 * Integrating the optimized models into a cohesive solution.
 * Conducting rigorous testing and validation using a separate test dataset.
##### Day 26-28: Testing and Validation
 * Evaluating the finalized model on the test set to assess its generalization performance.
 * Fine-tuning the model based on insights gained from testing.
 * Addressing any issues or inconsistencies identified during testing as a team. 
##### Day 29-30: Presentation and Final Touches
 * Preparing a comprehensive presentation outlining the problem statement, methodology, results, and insights.
 * Creating visualizations (e.g., plots, charts) to effectively communicate key findings.
 * Practicing the presentation as a team and incorporating feedback.

### I think this is good and well structured approach for hackathon that is 1 month away.
