Here are a few key metrics along with my understanding of them:**\n"," #### 1. Euclidean Distance\n","  The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in an n-dimensional space.\n","  It represents the shortest distance between two vectors.It is majorly used in nearest neighbour methods.\n","  \n","The Euclidean distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by:\n","\n","$$\n","d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- $d$ is the Euclidean distance,\n","- $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\n","\n","\n"," #### 2. Manhattan Distance\n","  Manhattan Distance is the sum of absolute differences between points across all the dimensions.\n","\n","  \n","The Manhattan distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n","\n","$$\n","d = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- $d$ is the Manhattan distance,\n","- $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\n","\n","\n","#### 3. Mahalanobis Distance\n","The Mahalanobis distance takes into account the covariance structure of the data and measures the distance between a point and a distribution.\n","\n","The Mahalanobis distance between two points $x$ and $y$, given a covariance matrix $S$, is defined as:\n","\n","$$\n","d(x,y) = \\sqrt{ (x-y)^\\top S^{-1} (x-y) }\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- $d(x,y)$ is the Mahalanobis distance,\n","- $x$ and $y$ are vectors representing the points,\n","- $S$ is the covariance matrix.\n","\n","\n","#### 3. Frechet Distance\n","The Fréchet distance measures the similarity between two curves or trajectories in a metric space. It is basically the the minimum length of a leash required for a person to walk along one curve while a dog walks along the other curve, without backtracking.\n","\n","Given two curves \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) represented by sequences of points $P = (p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n)$ and $Q = (q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_m)$, where each point $p_i$ and $q_j$ has coordinates $(x_i^P, y_i^P)$ and $(x_j^Q, y_j^Q)$ respectively, the Fréchet distance $d_F$ is defined as:\n","\n","$$\n","d_F(P, Q) = \\inf_{\\alpha, \\beta} \\max_{t \\in [0,1]} \\|P(\\alpha(t)) - Q(\\beta(t))\\|\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- $d_F$ is the Fréchet distance,\n","- $P(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are parameterizations of the curves $P$ and $Q$,\n","- $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ range over continuous non-decreasing functions that map $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$,\n","- $\\|\\cdot\\|$ represents the Euclidean distance between points.\n","\n","In simpler terms, the Fréchet distance considers all possible ways of traversing the two curves and chooses the traversal that minimizes the maximum distance between corresponding points on the curves.\n","\n","\n","#### 3. Hamming Distance\n","The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding coordinates of two vectors differ. It measures the similarity between two strings. It works only if strings are of some length.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","\n","#### The choice of metric distance depends on requirements and constraints of environment and as per my understanding of distance metrics, I think in the case of 2D grid with interlocking paths *Manhattan distance* is the most appropriate choice.\n","\n","#### Here are few reasons why I think Manhattan distance is best in this case:\n","* It accurately models the actual distance traveled in a grid environment, where only horizontal and vertical movements are allowed, and diagonal movements are prohibited.\n","* It aligns with the concept of city blocks, where the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences between their coordinates.\n","* Avoids overestimation or underestimation errors associated with other metrics that assume diagonal movements or consider only maximum coordinate differences.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"12e1SBk3_5jo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","#### Q2.  While researching on Transformers you learn about embeddings and how words are transformed into Numerical Vectors of High dimensional space, and stored on what basis the ‘likeliness’ of any two vectors are.  \n"," * #### What is the common criterion used to define this ‘likeliness’ mathematically between any two words?\n","\n"," * #### Generate a corpus of words then convert these words into embeddings then using this criterion plot these embeddings in 3D space (for simplicity).\n"," * #### Use any Relevant Python Libraries to do the computations and metric definitions.
