This is assignment for AIC, IIT Bombay
## Technical questions
Q1. I created a Object detection code using pretrainedd model resnet. I freezedd the intial layers and then fine tuned it. I trained it on CIFAR100 dataset containing 100classes.

Q2.


## Non Technical questions
### Q1. Timeline of events if Hackathon was 1 month away.
_________________
### Week 1: Understanding the Problem and Gathering Resources
  ##### Day 1-2: Problem Statement Analysis
   * Reviewing the hackathon guidelines and problem statement thoroughly.
   * Understanding the requirements and constraints.
   * Formulating the problem statement quantitatively.
   * Researching about existing solutions and techniques.
   * Gathering relevant papers, articles, and resources.
 ##### Day 3-4: Data Collection and Exploration
   * Acquiring datasets from reliable sources such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, 
     directly from the organizer (if provided).
   * Exploring the datasets to understand their structure, features, and potential challenges.
   * Ensuring the data is diverse, covering various topics and sentiments.
 ##### Day 5-7: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   * Performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution of 
     features, correlations, and patterns
   * Visualizing the data using plots and graphs to gain insights into the data's 
     characteristics
### Week 2: Advanced Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
   ##### Day 8-10: Data Preprocessing
   * Clean the data by removing special characters, URLs, and stop words
   * Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   * Spliting the data into training, validation, and test sets
   ##### Day 11-14: Feature Engineering
   * Creating new features based on domain knowledge or insights from EDA.
   * Performing feature scaling or transformation if necessary.
   * Experimenting with different feature selection techniques.
### Week 3: Model Development and Optimization
  ##### Day 15-17: Model Selection
   * Experimenting with various machine learning and deep learning models suitable for sentiment analysis, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, or Transformers.
   * Training baseline models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest) to establish a benchmark.
##### Day 18-21: Model Optimization
  * Fine-tuneing hyperparameters using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
  * Implementing ensemble methods (e.g., stacking, boosting) to improve model performance.
  * Validating model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the validation set.
### Week 4: Finalizing and Testing the Solution
 ##### Day 22-25: Solution Refinement
  * Refining selected models based on validation results.
 
 * Documenting the entire workflow, including preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and optimization.
##### Day 26-28: Testing and Validation
 * Evaluating the finalized model on the test set to assess its generalization performance.
 * Conducting sensitivity analysis to understand the robustness of the model to variations in input parameters.
 * Fine-tuning the model based on insights gained from testing.
##### Day 29-30: Presentation and Final Touches
 * Preparing a comprehensive presentation outlining the problem statement, methodology, results, and insights.
 * Creating visualizations (e.g., plots, charts) to effectively communicate key findings.
 * Having a good practice by presenting to peers for feedback
### I think this is good and well structured approach for hackathon that is 1 month away.
