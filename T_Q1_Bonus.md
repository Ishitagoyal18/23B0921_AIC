## Vision-Based Transformers

In the research paper titled **'AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS:
TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE'**, the authors present an innovative application of transformer models to image recognition. This model has been highly succesful in Natural Language Processing(NLP).
But it can be used for image classification as well. Images can be broken down in smaller patches and each patch can be treated as a word in a sentence. These transformers can be processed through transformers to understand the whole image and finally the model predicts the class of the image.
