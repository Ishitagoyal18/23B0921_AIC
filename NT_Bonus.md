## Bonus Question

The major idea that is in my mind for so long and I really want to work on is:

 **Creating an AI platform for insti students where they can get all their internship doubts cleared**. The main picture I have in my mind is: students sign up, tell the system what skills they've got, and what kind of work they're interested in. Then,  It recommends internships that match their skills and interests, and gives them tips on writing resumes, acing interviews, and networking.
 
 We can start by analysing the students' skills and works maybe using machine learning algorithm. Natural Language Processing can be used for resume writting recommendations. Honestly I dont have a very clear technical approach to this but I feel working as a team on this and gaining insights from mentors will be great
 
 The major reason to work on this idea is because I have been facing this difficulty myself so I am sure there are many students who might be stuck in this. This idea is in my mind ever since I have started to look for internships and I really want to work on this.
