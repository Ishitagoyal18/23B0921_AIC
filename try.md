### Non Technical Assignment ###
*Question 1*<br>
Here is the 1 month timeline:<br>
--> Pre-requisits<br>
    First of all we must purchase google colab subscription so that training time reduces and we can train our model easily and quickly over a large dataset.<br>
    We may use TPU or GPU according to the batch size of database we are   training.<br>
    Have a sample dataset ready

#    Week:1- 
        DAY 1 to DAY 4:
            1) Deeply analyse the problem statement in consideration with our team and to develop a  quantitative structure we are going to follow. 
            2) Divide the team in groups and give them tasks like dataset exploration, model selection, model development , preprocessing of images and other metrics.
        DAY 5 to DAY 7:
            1) After the formations of different units, each unit must start researching on their parts and decide what all things they are going to use
            2) They must have a plan ready how to execute their part and to be sure they will go on this plan
#    Week:2- 
        DAY 1 to DAY 2:
            1) These 2 Days will be crucial as the team as a whole will discuss the plan about what they will use a dataset and what will be the model and so on.
            2) In these 2 days the team will try to use the dataset and have a look at the dataset that the dataset is good to go or not.
        DAY 3 to DAY 7:
            1) These 5 days the unit which is enriching the database , doing annotations if needed and merging different databases if needed
            2) The remaining unit will start testing their preparing their models and will start testing on the sample dataset.
            3) The image preprocessing model essential and needs to be done just after so the whole team can help in developing or improving the dataset.
            4) The model development team should decide what they will be using a pretrained model like ResNet50V2 or VGG16 or VGG19 etc or they will be going with the model made by them on their own.
#    Week:3-
        DAY 1 to DAY 5:
            1) Now as we are in the penultimate week we should start training the model and try by adding different or multiple layers, using different learning rates , using different batch size , changing the no. of epochs and so on. You can also use functions like early stopping.
            2) We must plot graph after every iteration and then save each model so that we can go back to the previous prepared model whenever we want to in case of low accuracy and factors like that.
            3) Also the dataset teams must arrange new datasets for testing purpose of the model
            4) The image pre-processing team must continue to work on their model in order to train the cnn modal with higher accuracy.
        DAY 6 to DAY 7:
            1) Now testing of model should begin and these 2 days are very crucial as these will be the 2 last days when we will be implementing the major changes to the model.
            2) Graphs and other curves must be polt so as to better understand about the models and other important things.
#    Week:4-
        DAY 1 to DAY 2:
            1) Now we are in the final week of this hackathon so we will just test the model and check how is the accuracy on different prepared datasets for testing purposes.
            2) We may add one or two more layers so as to increase accuracy and test them but we need to performs these changes fast and now whole team has to work on these things as a whole.
            3) Model will be checked for minute errors and these errors should be rectified as soon as possible
        DAY 3 to DAY 5:
            1) In these 3 days their will be rigorous training and testing of models to variety of samples so that the model is trained pretty well and then the accuracy will also increase in testing
            2) Changes in this time period to the model will be reluctant and Changes will not be made that easily.
            3) * Changes will only be made to the model if and only if they increase the accuracy by a tremendous amount.
        DAY 6 to DAY 7:
            1) Now we are 100% prepared for the hackathon and these 2 days are the buffer days in case there is an issue with the above schedule.
            2) These 2 days we can also train the model even better for a higher accuracy and we good to go in the hackathon :)
